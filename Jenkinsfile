/* To set up automatic Jenkins pipeline configuration for any GitHub commit, follow these steps:

Install the GitHub plugin in Jenkins.
Create a new Jenkins pipeline project.
Under the "Source Code Management" section, select "Git" and enter the repository URL for your GitHub project.
Under the "Build Triggers" section, select "Poll SCM" and set the schedule for how often Jenkins should check for new commits.
In the pipeline script, include the appropriate steps for building and deploying your application.
Save the configuration and run the pipeline to ensure it is working correctly.
Now, with each new commit in the GitHub repository, Jenkins will automatically trigger a build and deployment of the application according to the pipeline script. */
